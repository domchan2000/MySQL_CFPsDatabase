# MySQL_CFPsDatabase
Assignment of designing a database to record CFPs in 2021

Call for Papers or CFP is a popular term in academic research. Fundamentally, it is an announcement for
the researchers to submit their research articles for upcoming conferences, journals or books. The CFPs
can be classified into these three categories: Conferences, Journals and Books.

We want to design a database to record all the CFPs. Below are the links for three recent events (one
example from each kind of CFP) for which we have received the CFP announcements:
• Conference CFP: http://cs-conferences.acadiau.ca/ant-21/#callforPapers
• Journal CFP: https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-information-security-andapplications/call-for-papers/special-issue-on-trends-in-cybersecurity

Task 1: Identify the entities, attributes, relationships and business rules.
